Higher-level programming - Python Programming Python Prog. Lang Icon
In this repository, you'll find programs written for the higher-level programming track (started in Sprint 2) at ALX Africa. These projects commenced during the 4th month of the Software Engineering program curriculum, where I am presently immersing myself in Python. Alongside Python, I've been actively strengthening and broadening my proficiency in C and shell scripting. The subsequent section outlines the projects included: (would be updated as I push):

0x00. Python - Hello, World
0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
0x02. Python - import & modules
0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
0x05. Python - Exceptions
0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
0x07. Python - Test-driven development
0x08-python-more_classes
0x09-python-everything_is_object
0x0A-Python-Inheritance
0x0B-python-input_output
0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
